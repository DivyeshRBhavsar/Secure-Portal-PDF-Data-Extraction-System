# SECURE PORTAL PDF DATA EXTRACTION SYSTEM


## Problem Statement
    The client needs a dashboard to enable analysis of data extracted from PDF reports hosted within a secure system portal. And right now, all data needs to be manually downloaded and processed, which is time‑consuming and prone to human error. 
   
    To tackle these challenges, we need an automated pipeline to log into the portal securely, extract information from PDF reports, and to keep the dataset in an organized configuration without redundancy and inconsistency. This solution will offer reliable data analytics and help develop an interactive dashboard for ongoing monitoring and decision‑making.


## Objectives
- Automate login to a secure web portal
- Download PDF reports
- Extract and clean tabular data
- Deliver data in CSV format
